# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game built using Python. The game allows the player to control a snake and navigate it around the screen to eat food and grow longer. The objective of the game is to avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sajan69/snakeonpy.git

```



## Usage

To start the game, run the following command:

```bash
python snakegame.py
```

Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake's movement. The snake will automatically move in the direction specified by the arrow key. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
